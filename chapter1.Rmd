# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.*

*I have a very tight schedule at the moment, and I am not sure whether I will have time to complete the exercises on time. I will try my best, though.*
